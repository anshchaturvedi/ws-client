Wealthsimple is great, but they don't output information about your investments that well. Graphs are mediocre at best, can't see dividend-reinvestment growth information, amongst other things.

I want to create my own tool that visualizes these data points better. I don't really know what I want to show, but I think that will come to me as I think about this project more.

This is just a start! 

P.S. There's some sketchy stuff I do, like generating my own TOTP codes instead of using Google Authenticator (to automate it), just be aware if you use my code.
